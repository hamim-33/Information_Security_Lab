### ECB mode does not inherently require padding because each block is encrypted independently. If the plaintext size is not a multiple of the block size, the last block can be encrypted without any additional padding.
##### Command : openssl enc -aes-256-ecb -in test.txt -out encrypted_ecb.bin -K 30313233343536373839616263646566
### CBC mode typically requires padding to ensure that the plaintext size is a multiple of the block size. Padding is necessary to fill the incomplete block before encryption.
##### Command : openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in test.txt -out encrypted_cbc.bin -K 30313233343536373839616263646566 -iv 0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f10
### CFB mode does not require padding because it operates in a streaming fashion, where the output of the encryption process is XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. Padding is not necessary as it does not operate on fixed-size blocks.
##### Command : openssl enc -aes-256-cfb -in test.txt -out encrypted_cfb.bin -K 30313233343536373839616263646566 -iv 0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f10
### Similar to CFB mode, OFB mode does not require padding because it operates in a streaming fashion. Padding is unnecessary as it does not operate on fixed-size blocks.
##### Command : openssl enc -aes-256-ofb -in test.txt -out encrypted_ofb.bin -K 30313233343536373839616263646566 -iv 0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f10
## In summary, ECB mode does not require padding, while CBC mode typically requires padding to fill incomplete blocks. CFB and OFB modes do not require padding as they operate in a streaming fashion. Padding is essential for modes like CBC to maintain the block alignment and ensure correct encryption and decryption.
