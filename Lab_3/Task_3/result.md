#### After corrupting the encrypted files, it was observed that only the Output Feedback (OFB) mode was able to successfully decrypt the original text. This can be attributed to the error propagation characteristics of OFB mode, where a single bit corruption in the ciphertext only affects the corresponding bit in the decrypted plaintext block and does not propagate errors to subsequent blocks. In contrast, other modes like ECB, CBC, and CFB may propagate errors to subsequent blocks during decryption, leading to a loss of synchronization and rendering the decryption process ineffective after corruption. Therefore, OFB mode demonstrated greater resilience to single bit errors or corruption in the ciphertext compared to other modes.
